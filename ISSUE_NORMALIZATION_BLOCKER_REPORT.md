## DUPLICATES DETECTED

### CRITICAL DUPLICATE: #55 and #56

**Issue #55**: "Add comprehensive test suite" (enhancement)  
**Issue #56**: "Fix: Implement proper testing infrastructure" (bug)

**Identical Body Text:**
> Current test setup fails because npm is not available in the environment. Need to implement proper testing infrastructure with both JavaScript and Python tests working correctly.

**Action Required:**
- Keep #56 as canonical (properly labeled as bug, critical P0)
- Close #55 as duplicate with reference to #56

---

## PRIORITY ISSUES SUMMARY

### P0 (Critical) - 1 Issue
- **#56**: Testing infrastructure broken - blocks all testing

### P1 (High) - 2 Issues  
- **#57**: Missing data directories - affects ETL workflow
- **#2**: No documentation - repository needs docs

### P2 (Medium) - 5 Issues
- **#34**: Standardize GitHub Actions language
- **#5**: Analyze GH Action logs
- **#4**: Set up cache for runner
- **#3**: Repository optimization

### P3 (Low) - 3 Issues
- **#53**: Consolidate PRs (housekeeping)
- **#8**: Test triage token
- **#6**: Test triage automation

## BLOCKER DETAILS

**Error Message:**
```
GraphQL: Resource not accessible by integration (addLabelsToLabelable)
GraphQL: Resource not accessible by integration (createIssue)
```

**Root Cause:**
GitHub Actions GITHUB_TOKEN lacks required permissions:
- `issues:write` - needed to add/remove labels
- `issues:create` - needed to create new issues

**Workaround Options:**
1. Grant `issues:write` and `issues:create` permissions to the GitHub App/Integration
2. Use a personal access token (PAT) with appropriate scopes
3. Manually apply labels and handle duplicates via GitHub UI

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Requires Admin Access)
1. Grant `issues:write` and `issues:create` permissions to the GitHub Integration
2. Re-run the autonomous agent to complete normalization

### Manual (If Agent Cannot Be Enabled)
1. Apply labels to all 11 issues per the table above
2. Close #55 as duplicate of #56 with reference
3. Review and prioritize P0 and P1 issues first

---

## NEXT STEPS

**If permissions are granted:**
- Re-run ISSUE MANAGER MODE - STEP 1
- Proceed to STEP 2: Duplicate Detection

**If permissions cannot be granted:**
- Continue to PHASE 1 (Deep Code & Doc Analysis) with 11 open issues
- Proceed with codebase scanning and analysis

---

## FINAL STATE

**Status:** BLOCKED  
**Reason:** Missing GitHub Integration permissions  
**Waiting For:** Admin to grant `issues:write` and `issues:create` permissions
