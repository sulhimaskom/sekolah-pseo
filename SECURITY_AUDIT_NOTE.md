# Security Audit - June 2026 (Pass 5)

## Summary

Comprehensive security audit of the Indonesian School PSEO project (static site generator). This is the **5th security audit pass** (following TASK-022, TASK-031, TASK-036, TASK-044). All workflow security fixes from prior audits had regressed again during a main→agent merge and have been re-applied.

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `on-push.yml`: Duplicate `API_KEY` + wrong `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` mapping              | Critical | Removed duplicate `API_KEY`; removed incorrectly mapped `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`                                                 |
| 2   | `parallel.yml`: 4 duplicate `API_KEY` entries (architect, specialist, Fixer, PR-Handler) | Critical | Removed all 4 `API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}` entries                                                                   |
| 3   | `orchestrator.yml`: `secrets.GH_TOKEN` instead of `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`                 | High     | Replaced both occurrences with `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`                                                                            |
| 4   | `architect-agent.yml`: `secrets.GH_TOKEN` instead of `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`              | High     | Replaced with `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`                                                                                             |
| 5   | `id-token: write` in 5 non-OIDC workflows                                                | High     | Removed from `parallel.yml`, `on-pull.yml`, `opencode.yml`, and from both levels of `orchestrator.yml` and `architect-agent.yml` |
| 6   | `actions: write` in 4 non-merge workflows                                                | High     | Removed from `parallel.yml` and from both levels of `orchestrator.yml` and `architect-agent.yml`                                 |

### Code Quality

- ✅ ESLint: 0 errors
- ✅ Prettier: formatting clean
- ✅ JS Tests: all pass
- ✅ Build: all pages generate successfully
- ✅ Python Tests: all pass

### CI/CD Security

- ✅ GITHUB_TOKEN: auto-provisioned, minimal scope (all workflows now use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- ✅ Overly permissive `id-token: write` removed from all 5 non-OIDC workflows (parallel.yml, orchestrator.yml, architect-agent.yml, opencode.yml, on-pull.yml)
- ✅ Overly permissive `actions: write` removed from all non-merge workflows (parallel.yml, orchestrator.yml, architect-agent.yml, opencode.yml)
- ✅ Duplicate `API_KEY` → `GEMINI_API_KEY` mapping removed (6 occurrences across 2 workflow files: on-push.yml + parallel.yml)
- ✅ Misconfigured `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` mapping removed from on-push.yml
- ✅ `secrets.GH_TOKEN` replaced with `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` in orchestrator.yml and architect-agent.yml
- ✅ `docs/security-engineer.md` — Removed deprecated `X-XSS-Protection` reference
- ⚠️ `on-push.yml` still exposes secrets on every push (by design for AI automation)
- ✅ No secrets in code or logs

### Root Cause of Regression

All issues in this audit were regressions from prior fixes (TASK-022, TASK-031, TASK-036, TASK-044). The root cause: security fixes were applied only on the `agent` branch but never merged to `main`. When `main` was subsequently merged into `agent` during synchronization, the unfixed versions from `main` overwrote the fixed versions. This has happened **4 times** now.

**Recommendation**: To prevent future regression, merge the `agent` branch to `main` after each security audit so fixes are persisted in the default branch. Until then, workflow file fixes must be re-applied after every `main→agent` merge. A `.omo/plans/` workflow check or pre-merge CI gate should verify that `id-token: write` and `API_KEY` duplicates are not present in any workflow file.

## Score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Excellent security posture
